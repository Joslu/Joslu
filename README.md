I'm really into tech. My professional degree is mechatronics engineering, so I've spent a lot of time dealing with hardware – stuff like __automation__, __wires__, __code__, and playing around with __robots__ 🤖

But there's more to the story: I've got a natural flair for software development, and I've been enjoying it for a long time with personal and professional software projects.

My passion and love for technology has driven me into this field, and to see what more can be achieved with a bit of code.

Besides this, I do photography and enjoy nature.
